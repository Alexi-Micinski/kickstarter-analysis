# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is using the Kickstarter fundraising platform to fund her play *Fever*. Her goal is to raise over $10,000 for her project. Analysis of the Kickstarter data will provide insights into what factors make a project's campaign sucessful. Excel will be used to organize, sort, and analyze the crowdfunding data.

### Purpose
Louise wants to know how her campaign launch dates and fundraising goals compare to others. Data analysis will be used to understand campaigns from start to finish and help Louise mirror other successful campaigns. Campaign outcomes will be analyzed and visualized based on launch dates and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

The Kickstarter data was first downloaded and saved in organized and easy to access folders. The data was then resized, organized, and formatted for the purpose of familiarization. Filters, conditional formatting, and the freeze panes features were also used in getting aquainted with the data. It is important to be familiar with the data before attempting to manipulate or summarize it. 

Next filters were applied and subcategories were parsed out from parent categories in order to create more detailed data for analysis. Louise's project falls under the theater category and plays subcategory. From here summary tables, pivot charts, and graphs were created to summarize the data in a more digestible and readable way. Factors that make a successful campaign can then be more easily interpreted from the summary tables and graphs.

Louise is intersted in campaign oucomes based on launch dates and funraising goals. Campaign outcomes are categorized based on if they were successful, failed, or canceled.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The mean goal for successful campaigns in the US is $5,049 and $10,554 for failed campaigns. Failed campaigns typically have higher goals than successful campaigns, although higher goals don't cause campaigns to fail because the mean pledged amounts are lower than the mean sucessful pledges.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
