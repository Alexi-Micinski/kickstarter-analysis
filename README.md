# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

Louise is preparing a Kickstarter campaign for her play. She hopes to raise over $10,000. Analysis of the Kickstarter data will give insights into what makes a campaign sucessful.

Plays make up the largest theater subcategory in the US with the majority being successful.

May, June, and July are the three most successful launch months for theater campaigns in the US. However, June and July have higher failure rates.

The mean goal for successful campaigns in the US is $5,049 and $10,554 for failed campaigns. Failed campaigns typically have higher goals than successful campaigns, although higher goals don't cause campaigns to fail because the mean pledged amounts are lower than the mean sucessful pledges.

Louise should consider kicking off her campaign in May.
